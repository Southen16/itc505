    <h2>Process and Creative Choices</h2>

    <p>
      1.HTML Structure: The HTML structure is minimal and focuses on the core
      elements of the game. '' contains a heading for the game title, '' for the
      game layout, and '' for resetting the game board. Semantic tags improve
      the readability of your code.
    </p>

    <p>
      2.CSS Style:CSS uses flexbox and grid layout for responsiveness.
      Background images add visual appeal, and contrasting colors ensure
      readability. Styles are logically organized, making them easy to
      understand and modify. Timer and footer styles add to the overall
      aesthetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.JavaScript logic:The JavaScript code is well structured and uses
      functions for various game functions. Constants like "LAYOUT_SIZE" make
      your code more flexible. Event listeners handle user interactions such as:
      B. Click the cell or reset the board. The randomization feature
      ('randomizelayout') ensures a dynamic and challenging gaming experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.Game Logic:The game follows the concept of Lights Out puzzles, where
      clicking on a cell toggles the state of that cell and the state of
      adjacent cells. The "checkWin" function determines whether the player
      successfully turned off all lights. The game initializes, renders, and
      randomizes the layout on page load.</p>
    <sp>5.Timer Function: A timer
      function has been implemented to track the player's progress. It starts
      when the page loads and resets when the game is restarted. The timer is
      displayed in a dedicated '' element.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and how they were overcome</h2>
    <p>
      1. Styling challenges: Achieving a visually appealing design while
      remaining responsive was a challenge. Through the use of flexbox and grid
      layout, and careful color selection, we were able to create a visually
      pleasing interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.Randomization logic:It was difficult to randomize the original layout
      while still allowing the puzzle to be solved. Iterative testing and
      refinement of the randomization function were essential to finding a
      balance between randomness and solvability.</p>
      <p>3 Timer implementation: 
      Including a timer that starts on page load and restarts every time the
      game is reset required careful consideration of the timer lifecycle. .
      Using a combination of 'setInterval' and 'clearInterval' solved this
      challenge.
    </p>
    <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
    <p>
      1.Code organization:Well-organized code with clear separation of concerns
      is critical to readability and maintainability . Functions such as
      "toggleLights", "toggleCell", and "checkWin" contribute to modular and
      understandable code.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.User Experience:It's important to balance game difficulty with a fun
      user experience. Random logic provides each game with a unique challenge
      to keep players interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.Responsive Design: Combining flexbox and grid layout with responsive
      design principles is effective in creating visually appealing and
      adaptable interfaces for different screen sizes. It's a target.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.Timers and User Engagement:Incorporating timers increases user
      engagement and competitiveness. You can get a sense of accomplishment by
      notifying the player's progress with a timer.
